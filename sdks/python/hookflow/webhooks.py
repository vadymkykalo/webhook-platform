    Verify webhook signature using HMAC-SHA256.

    The header is ``t=<unix-ms>,v1=<hex>`` and may carry more than one ``v1``.
    After you rotate an endpoint's secret, Hookflow signs each delivery with both
    the new secret and the retired one for the endpoint's grace window (24 hours
    by default), so the new secret can be deployed whenever you like rather than
    at the instant you press rotate. The delivery is authentic if *any* ``v1``
    matches.

    Two things differ from Hookflow's own scheme beyond the header names: the message id is
    part of what is signed, and the digest is base64 rather than hex. Rotation behaves the
