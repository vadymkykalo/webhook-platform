/**
 * Renders the public pages to static HTML after the Vite build.
 *
 * The app is a single-page bundle, so what nginx serves for every URL is
 * `<div id="root"></div>` and nothing else. A crawler that does not run
 * JavaScript — and several that do, budget-permitting — sees an empty document
 * on the landing page, the pricing page and thirteen documentation guides.
 * Every other SEO fix in this repo (per-route titles, canonicals, the sitemap,
 * JSON-LD) points at pages whose body is empty until React mounts.
 *
 * This walks the built `dist` with a real browser and writes what it finds back
 * over `dist/<route>/index.html`. A real browser rather than `renderToString`
 * because the app is not written to be server-safe — `AmbientDelivery` reads
 * `matchMedia`, the auth store reads `localStorage`, the locale bundles are
 * dynamic imports — and hardening all of that would put a constraint on every
 * future import that nothing enforces. Puppeteer runs the app exactly as a
 * visitor does, which also means a page that throws is a page that fails the
 * build here rather than one that quietly renders empty.
 *
 * Not part of `npm run build`: the frontend CI job builds to typecheck and lint,
 * and making that job download a browser would cost minutes on every push. The
 * Dockerfile runs it as its own step, so the image that ships is prerendered and
 * the fast path stays fast.
 *
 *   npm run build && npm run prerender
