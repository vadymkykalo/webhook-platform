/**
 * The seeded plan rows, in one place.
 *
 * Every number here is `V036__billing_plans.sql`, with the tunnel limits from
 * V042 and the yearly prices from V038 — the same values `QuotaEnforcementAspect`
 * applies at runtime. It lives outside `PricingSection` because the hero quotes
 * the free plan's allowance in a sentence and the pricing grid renders it in a
 * table: two hand-typed copies of the same figure drift the first time a plan
 * changes, and the one on the hero is the one nobody thinks to update.
 *
 * `null` is unlimited, matching the `-1` the backend stores.
