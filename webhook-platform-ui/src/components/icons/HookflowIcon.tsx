 * The Hookflow mark: a hook whose tail turns up into a delivery arrow.
 *
 * Redrawn because the first version was built at 24px and collapsed into an
 * unreadable squiggle by the time it reached the 14–16px it is actually used
 * at — in the sidebar, the nav and inside the hero diagram. This one is drawn
 * on a 20-unit grid with a heavier stroke, a wider hook radius and the arrow
 * moved clear of the stem, so the two halves stay distinguishable when the
 * whole mark is 14 pixels across.
