/**
 * What the getting-started card knows, with no React and no i18n in the way.
 *
 * <p>Every bug this module replaces was a derivation bug wearing JSX. The old
 * checklist decided a step's state inside its own markup, so two of its rows
 * were the literal `false` — unreachable forever — and a third read the flag
 * belonging to the row above it. None of that was visible to a test.
 *
 * <p>So the rule this file exists to enforce: a step's `done` is a function of
 * its inputs and nothing else. `stepsFor` takes everything it is allowed to
 * know and returns keys, never sentences. A row wired to a constant, or to a
 * neighbour's evidence, fails in CI rather than shipping.
