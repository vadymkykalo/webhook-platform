# Fails when webhook-platform-ui/src/types/api.generated.ts is not what
# openapi.yaml currently generates.
#
# openapi.yaml is itself kept honest against springdoc by
# OpenApiDriftIntegrationTest, so it is a trustworthy description of the
# backend without a running server. This extends that guarantee to the
# frontend: the generated types are committed, and any change to a DTO has to
# show up in the diff of this file rather than surfacing as a runtime
# `undefined` in the browser.
#
# The generated file is not what the app imports — springdoc marks nothing
# `required`, so every generated property is optional and consuming them
# directly would put a null check on every field read. src/types/api.contract.ts
# is what closes that gap: it asserts, at compile time, that the hand-written
# mirror in api.types.ts still matches these schemas. So this script keeps the
# schemas current and `npm run typecheck` keeps the mirror honest against them.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-types-drift.sh
# Regenerate with: cd webhook-platform-ui && npm run types:generate
