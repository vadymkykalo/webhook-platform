-- Convert delivery_attempts to declarative RANGE partitioning by created_at
-- (monthly). This is the single biggest disk/vacuum cost in the schema — it stores
-- full request/response bodies and headers per attempt — and was pruned entirely by
-- DELETE (DataRetentionService.cleanupOldDeliveryAttempts, 90-day global cutoff),
-- which means every retention run scans and deletes rows across the whole
-- accumulated table and leaves bloat behind for autovacuum to fight.
--
-- TECHNIQUE (safe for a live, populated table): this migration does NOT rewrite
-- existing rows — that would mean copying the entire table inside one Flyway
-- transaction, which does not scale and holds locks for however long the copy takes.
-- Instead:
--   1. Rename the existing table (and the constraint/index names it holds) out of the
--      way — ALTER TABLE/INDEX ... RENAME is a metadata-only operation, effectively
--      instant regardless of table size.
--   2. Create a new partitioned table named delivery_attempts.
--   3. Attach the renamed table as the partition covering everything strictly before
--      the start of the current month — all pre-cutover history stays exactly where
--      it physically is, just reachable through the partitioned parent now.
--   4. Create partitions for the current month plus the next 2 months, and a DEFAULT
--      partition as a safety net so inserts never fail outright if the partition
--      maintenance job (PartitionMaintenanceService) falls behind.
--
-- See docs/runbooks/partition-high-volume-tables.md for the full populated-database
-- procedure: pre-validating the attach constraint ahead of the deploy window so the
-- ATTACH itself is instant, lock levels at each step, and rollback.
--
-- WHY THE PRIMARY KEY WIDENS: Postgres requires every unique/primary-key index on a
-- partitioned table to include the partition key column. `id` remains globally unique
-- in practice — both JPA copies of this entity use
-- `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.UUID)`, which assigns the UUID
-- client-side before every INSERT — so widening PRIMARY KEY to (id, created_at), and
-- the (delivery_id, attempt_number) uniqueness constraint to include created_at,
-- changes nothing observable to either application: every query still keys on
-- id / delivery_id directly, and Hibernate's `ddl-auto: validate` only checks that
-- mapped columns exist with compatible types, not the shape of PK/unique constraints,
-- so no entity changes are required in api or worker.
--
-- RETENTION: dropping a whole partition (O(1), just unlinks files) replaces the
-- coarse 90-day sweep (cleanupOldDeliveryAttempts) — see PartitionMaintenanceService.
-- It does NOT replace the two finer-grained jobs that stay row-level DELETEs because
-- they are not simple time cutoffs: cleanupOldSuccessfulAttempts (14-day cutoff,
-- filtered by 2xx status only) and enforcePerDeliveryAttemptLimits (keep last N per
-- delivery, not time-based at all). Both keep working unchanged and now run against a
-- much smaller live partition instead of the whole accumulated table.

-- 1. Free up the names currently held by the unpartitioned table.
ALTER TABLE delivery_attempts RENAME TO delivery_attempts_legacy;
ALTER TABLE delivery_attempts_legacy RENAME CONSTRAINT delivery_attempts_pkey TO delivery_attempts_legacy_pkey;
ALTER INDEX idx_delivery_attempts_delivery_id RENAME TO idx_delivery_attempts_legacy_delivery_id;

ALTER INDEX idx_delivery_attempts_unique_attempt RENAME TO idx_delivery_attempts_legacy_unique_attempt;
ALTER INDEX idx_delivery_attempts_cleanup RENAME TO idx_delivery_attempts_legacy_cleanup;

-- 2. New partitioned parent — same columns/comment as V001/V035/V045, minus
--    idx_delivery_attempts_created_at (dropped as redundant below: it is a strict
--    left-prefix of idx_delivery_attempts_cleanup(created_at, http_status_code) with
--    no narrowing WHERE clause, so any created_at-range query the narrow index could
--    serve, the wide one serves too).

Successful (2xx) attempts are additionally pruned earlier via row-level DELETE at 14d (data-retention.successful-attempts-retention-days), which is finer-grained than a monthly partition boundary.';

-- 3 & 4. Attach pre-cutover history as one partition, then create forward partitions.
