/**
 * What an operator can see and do about a tenant, without a database client.
 *
 * <p>Everything under {@code /api/v1/admin/**} used to be one endpoint that rotates encryption
 * keys. An operator handling an abuse report, a support request, or a customer asking why their
 * deliveries stopped had psql and the logs — which is not a tool anyone should have to reach for
 * while a tenant is waiting, and is a poor place to make a decision that affects a paying
 * customer.
 *
 * <p>Every method here runs across organizations rather than inside one, which is the definition
 * of this credential: it belongs to whoever runs the deployment, and to no tenant. That is also
 * why none of it can be reached with a JWT or an API key however privileged — SecurityConfig
 * requires {@code PLATFORM_ADMIN}, which only the operator token carries.
