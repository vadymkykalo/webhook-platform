/**
 * Scheduled job that enforces per-plan retention limits.
 * <p>
 * Runs daily at 03:00 UTC. For each organization whose plan has a finite
 * {@code max_retention_days}, deletes events (and their cascaded deliveries /
 * delivery_attempts) that are older than the cutoff.
 * <p>
 * Deletions happen in batches to avoid long locks. Self-hosted plans
 * ({@code max_retention_days = -1}) are skipped (unlimited retention).
 * <p>
 * When {@code billing.enabled=false}, the scheduler is a no-op.
