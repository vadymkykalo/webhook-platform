/**
 * Ratchet over thread pools this module builds itself.
 *
 * <p>Spring's {@code TaskDecorator} hook reaches only the executors declared as beans in
 * {@code AsyncConfig}, whose javadoc says "every executor here gets it" — true of that file and
 * false of the codebase. Two pools were built by hand outside it, and each had grown its own
 * answer to the resulting gap: {@code AuditLogAspect} wrapped every task body in
 * {@code TenantContext.runAs}, and {@code WorkflowEngine} re-implemented
 * {@link TenantPropagatingTaskDecorator} inline — already missing its {@code captured == null}
 * pass-through, so an unscoped submission wrote {@code null} into the ThreadLocal rather than
 * leaving the worker thread's own scope alone.
 *
 * <p>Neither divergence failed anything. A task that starts with no tenant either throws
 * {@code TenantNotResolvedException} on its first session — which the audit writer's catch-all
 * swallowed into a log line — or, worse, runs under a scope left behind by the previous task on
 * that thread and stamps the wrong organization on a row.
 *
 * <p>So: a file that constructs a pool must also hand it to
 * {@link TenantPropagatingTaskDecorator#wrap}. The check is at file level on purpose — it asks
 * whether the author thought about propagation at all, not whether a particular expression is
 * shaped a particular way, and the reason is that the two ways of getting this wrong so far were
 * both "wrote something bespoke", not "wrote the wrapper slightly wrong".
 *
 * <p>Not covered, deliberately: a bare {@code @Async} with no qualifier, which lands on Spring
 * Boot's auto-configured {@code applicationTaskExecutor} rather than one of {@code AsyncConfig}'s.
 * There is one ({@code AlertNotificationService.dispatch}) and it is safe today because it touches
 * no {@code @TenantId} entity — it formats a message and makes an HTTP call. Widening this test to
 * cover it means either giving that method a decorated executor or exempting it, which is a
 * decision, not a ratchet.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately a plain {@code *Test}: it reads source files off disk and needs no Spring
 * context and no container, so it must run in the no-Docker unit job (see
 * {@code scripts/check-test-routing.sh}).
