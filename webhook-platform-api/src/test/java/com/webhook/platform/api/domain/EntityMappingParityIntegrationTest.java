/**
 * Parity ratchet over the entity duplication ADR-0002 keeps.
 *
 * <p>ADR-0002 says {@code api} and {@code worker} each keep their own {@code @Entity} copy of
 * every shared table, and that the decision stands. Its cost is that a schema change is a
 * three-file change — migration, api entity, worker entity — and that nothing in the build
 * noticed when only two of the three happened. Hibernate's {@code ddl-auto: validate} catches a
 * mapping that names a column the schema does not have; it cannot catch a column the schema has
 * and an entity never mentions. That direction is silent by construction, and it has cost two
 * production bugs:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code events.payload_compressed} unmapped by the worker's {@code Event}: every Event
 *       above the 1 KB compression threshold was delivered — and HMAC-signed — as a gzip+Base64
 *       blob instead of JSON.</li>
 *   <li>{@code endpoints.deleted_at} unmapped by the worker's {@code Endpoint}: a soft-deleted
 *       Endpoint kept receiving Deliveries for the whole life of its Retry Ladder.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Both columns had been in the schema for releases. This test makes that shape of gap fail
 * the build instead: for every table mapped by <em>both</em> modules, each schema column must be
 * mapped by both sides, or appear in {@link #DELIBERATELY_UNMAPPED} with a stated reason.
 *
 * <h2>Where the three inputs come from</h2>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Schema</b> — Flyway runs the real migrations into a throwaway Postgres and the column
 *       set is read from {@code information_schema.columns}. Deriving it by reading the SQL was
 *       tried and rejected: the schema is 55 migrations deep, and V052/V053 rebuild
 *       {@code delivery_attempts} and {@code tunnel_request_log} as partitioned tables by
 *       renaming the original aside and re-creating it, partly through dynamic SQL inside
 *       {@code DO $$} blocks. A hand-written DDL interpreter would be one more thing that can be
 *       silently wrong — which is the exact failure mode this test exists to remove. This is
 *       also what ADR-0002 asked for in as many words: "a test comparing each shared table's
 *       {@code information_schema} columns against both {@code @Entity} mappings".</li>
 *   <li><b>Which tables are shared</b> — derived from the filesystem, by intersecting the two
 *       entity package directories. A tenth shared entity is covered the day it is added; it is
 *       never a list anyone has to remember to update.</li>
 *   <li><b>What each side maps</b> — parsed out of the entity <em>sources</em> of both modules.
 *       The two modules are siblings in the reactor and neither depends on the other, so no
 *       module's test classpath can see both sets of classes. Adding a test-scoped edge was
 *       rejected: both modules ship an {@code application.yml} and a {@code logback-spring.xml}
 *       at the classpath root, so putting one on the other's test classpath makes which config
 *       wins a matter of jar order, and would quietly change how every existing
 *       {@code @SpringBootTest} in this module boots.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Why the source parser can be trusted</h2>
 *
 * <p>A parser that under-reports a mapping produces a loud false failure someone investigates. A
 * parser that over-reports one hides real drift, which is the dangerous direction, so it is
 * checked three ways:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #parsedMappingsResolveToRealColumns()} — every column either parser derives must
 *       exist in the migrated schema. Both modules run {@code ddl-auto: validate}, so a mapping
 *       the schema does not have could not boot; a column name this parser invents therefore
 *       fails here.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #sourceParserAgreesWithReflection()} — for the api side, whose classes <em>are</em>
 *       on this test's classpath, the source parser's answer must equal reflection's.</li>
 *   <li>{@link EntitySource#unhandled} — the parser never guesses. Any JPA construct it was not
 *       written for ({@code @Embedded}, a {@code @ManyToOne} with no {@code @JoinColumn}, a
 *       multi-name field declaration) is reported and fails the build, so extending the entities
 *       into new territory forces extending the parser rather than silently widening a blind
 *       spot.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Named {@code *IntegrationTest} on purpose: it starts a container, so CI must route it to the
 * Docker job — see {@code scripts/check-test-routing.sh}.
 */
@Testcontainers
class EntityMappingParityIntegrationTest {

    /**
     * Schema columns that are deliberately not mapped by one or both modules, and why.
     *
     * <p>Key is {@code table.column}; value is the reason. An entry here is a claim that the
     * omission is intentional and safe — the same weight as an entry in
     * {@code MutatingHandlerScopeDeclarationTest.DOCUMENTED_EXEMPTIONS}. Prefer mapping the
     * column. If you cannot say why a column is missing, it is drift, not an exemption.
     *
     * <p>Every entry below is a column the <em>worker</em> does not map; the api maps all of
     * them, which is the asymmetry ADR-0002 describes. Two reasons recur and are worth stating
     * once: a column can be safely unmapped either because only the api ever writes it, or
     * because the worker consumes its <em>outcome</em> through a different column it does map.
     * Neither reason survives the column being read on the delivery or forward path — which is
     * exactly what {@code payload_compressed} and {@code deleted_at} turned out to be.
