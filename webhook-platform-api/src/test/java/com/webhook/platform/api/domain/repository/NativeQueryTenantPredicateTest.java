/**
 * Ratchet over the one hole in the structural tenancy.
 *
 * <p>Everything else in this package is confined for free: the entities carry {@code @TenantId},
 * so Hibernate adds {@code organization_id = <current tenant>} when it builds the SQL, and a new
 * derived method or JPQL {@code @Query} inherits that without its author doing anything. A
 * {@code nativeQuery = true} method supplies its own SQL, so it inherits nothing — the rule is
 * stated in this package's {@code package-info} and, until this test, checked by nobody.
 *
 * <p>It has already been violated once in each direction of badness. {@code usage_daily} gained a
 * NOT NULL {@code organization_id} in V056 while its INSERT stayed native, so the nightly
 * aggregation hit a constraint violation at 00:05 every night — swallowed by the per-project catch
 * in {@code aggregateYesterday}, so nothing paged and the table simply stopped filling. The other
 * direction is worse and quieter: a native SELECT with no predicate returns other organizations'
 * rows, and looks exactly like a working query.
 *
 * <p>So every native query is one of two things, and has to say which:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>reachable from a request</b> — carries {@code organization_id} in its SQL, whether as a
 *       predicate on a read or a column on a write; or</li>
 *   <li><b>a system path that is meant to cross tenants</b> — retention deletes, outbox claims,
 *       table-size estimates. Listed in {@link #SYSTEM_PATHS} with the reason.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The check is on the SQL string rather than on runtime behaviour on purpose: {@code @Query} is
 * {@code RUNTIME}-retained, so this is plain reflection and runs in the no-Docker unit job. A
 * runtime check would need a container and would still only cover the paths some test happens to
 * exercise, which is the opposite of what a ratchet is for.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately a plain {@code *Test} — see {@code scripts/check-test-routing.sh}.
