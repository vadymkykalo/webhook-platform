# How Hookflow compares

Kept out of the README on purpose: a comparison table is the kind of thing that
grows, dates badly, and pushes the one command a reader actually needs below the
fold. It lives here so it can be as detailed as it wants to be.


The honest version. Hookflow is younger than Svix, Hookdeck and Convoy, and
there are things they do that it does not — the gaps are listed here rather
than left for you to find during an evaluation, and
[`ROADMAP.md`](../../ROADMAP.md) keeps that list current.

|  | Hookflow | Svix | Hookdeck | Convoy |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Self-hosted with every feature, no licence key | **yes** | open-source server, portal is the hosted product | SaaS (Outpost is the OSS piece) | open source, some features are paid |
| Sending webhooks | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| Receiving and forwarding webhooks | yes | — | yes | yes |
| Standard Webhooks signatures | yes | yes | — | own scheme |
| Secret rotation with an overlap window | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| Per-endpoint FIFO ordering | **yes** | yes | — | — |
| Replay as a new obligation, not a re-send | **yes** | re-send | re-send | re-send |
| Built-in request bin and localhost tunnel | **yes** | Svix Play | CLI | CLI |
| Workflow builder beyond transformations | **yes** | — | — | — |
| Customer-facing app portal | **no** | yes | — | Portal Links |
| SSO (SAML / OIDC) | **no** | yes | yes | yes |
| OpenTelemetry traces | **no** | yes | — | — |
| Custom roles, per-resource scoping | **no** | yes | yes | roles |
| Per-subscription filtering | **no** — project-level only | yes | yes | yes |
| Batching, static egress IPs, PagerDuty channel | **no** | varies | varies | varies |
| Terraform provider, Go SDK | **no** | yes | yes | yes |

**The one gap that matters most** is the app portal — a surface a customer
embeds in their own product so *their* users can register an endpoint, see why
a delivery failed, and replay it. That is the thing people pay Svix for, and
Hookflow has only a shareable single-event debug link. It is the top item on
the roadmap.

**Migrating is cheaper than it looks.** Hookflow implements Standard Webhooks
exactly, so a receiver already using a Svix or Standard Webhooks library keeps
working with a new secret and a new URL — nothing else changes. Both platforms
can run side by side with no cutover window; see
[the migration guide](migrating-from-other-providers.md).
